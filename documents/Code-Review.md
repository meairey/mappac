# Code Review
### Montana Airey
#### Projects reviewed: jessicahoch, kuratanp, nehasavant

#### Two out of the three README files that I read through made it very clear what the project was and how to install it. The one that didn't still provided relevant information on how to learn more about their project: visiting their other folders. 
#### I feel as if my README effectively conveyed the information that is necessary for someone to understand mappac and install it. One place where I think I could have improved was providing more information on how to download the data. 

#### One of the projects I looked at didn't have anything in the project file. I suspect that this is because it is written in r and she puts the r code in her tutorial in the notebooks file. I was able to understand the class object writen for the mlclusters project. And finally, the last project directory only contained copies of the tutorials but didnt contain simplified code script. Since it contained tutorial information, I was able to follow along with the written script. 

#### All projects have a directory named notebooks and each readme contains the instructions on how to locate the tutorials within them. I was able to understand the script within each one of the scripts. Each had descriptions, text blocks, and titles that walked the reader through the process of using their code. I think I would be able to replicate their process on my own if I had to. 

#### One thing I think I could do to improve my project is add more narrative to my tutorials. I liked the blocks of text that were used which describe the problems at hand, what the project is trying to solve, and how it goes through its process. Furthermore, there was one project that described an issue that they were having and are still actively trying to solve. I think that this would be usefull to include since I have been having troubles with the vectors.
